# Record Store Website 
This is my git repo that holds the work I've done towards creating a website that I will use to sell both merchandise from my band and any used vinyl/cd/tapes that I wish to sell. 

Currently following Brad Travery's MERN Ecommerce course in order to implement this: [Traversy MERN Course](https://www.traversymedia.com/mern-stack-from-scratch)


# To Do 
1. For some reason, when I started working on this on my desktop, Mongo Atlas connection no longer works on laptop; need to configure
2. Learn more about front end styling to personalize website

Resources for front end stuff:

[Travery's 'Create a Website With Video Background'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgpE2DTTKA)

[Traversy's 'CSS3 Animations and Transitions Crash Course'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHUpx90NerM) 


# Usage
This repo is currently incomplete; if you're looking for a working Ecom web application I'd recommend you use Traversy's compeleted repo instead:
